# Pairing feedback

## Week 1 (beginning 4 March)

### Matt Thompson (Wed)

Matt said he found that I gave clear explanations of some concepts. For example my explanation of instance variables and `attr_reader` was very helpful in helping him to understand them. He also appreciated my patience when we were going over areas like that that he didn't understand yet.
- Evidence of: good explanations shows understanding of concepts
- Evidence of: patience when pair is coming to understanding = good pairing

I appreciated Matt's pairing technique. We did a relaxed ping-pong method, not strictly alternating after writing every test, but making sure to alternate frequently so that we both remained engaged, at Matt's prompting.
- I learnt: some good pairing practice

### James Palmer (Thurs)

James said he appreciated the ping-pong pairing technique I introduced him to. He said my prompting to swap the keyboard at short intervals as we alternated writing tests and code was effective in keeping both of us engaged, and not zoning out. It also meant we both had practice writing both the code and the tests.
- Evidence of: good pairing

James also said he appreciated that I sometimes went back and wrote further tests for features we had already implemented to reveal deficiencies in our implementation, forcing us improve our code to meet the spec.
- Evidence of: good TDD practice

James pulled us out of a rabbit hole at one point by suggesting we use the exercise's 'walk through' help. We had spent around 20 minutes pursuing a particular path but didn't feel we were making substantial progress. After checking the walk through we realised there was a better approach and got back on track.
- I learnt: unblocking yourself by using available resources

### Harry Galliano (Friday)

> When pairing with you yesterday for the brief two hours that we had to work with I found it to be a very different type of pairing session than the other days of the week, this is because you were so much further ahead of me and i was playing catchup. This was actually very good for me in my eyes (potentially not great for you, as you were going back over things that you had done just a day before) because i really feel i learnt more about TDD and SRP than I had done on any of the other days.
>
> You were a really patient partner which was fantastic as you already seem to know lots about programming and you were very calm the whole way through the afternoon which really helped me to keep going and keep focused. I think the thing you did best was that you would always get me to try my ideas, even when they didn't work, this was great for me being able to visualise exactly why some of my ideas didn't work and you were then kind enough to explain the syntax to me, which was fantastic.

## Week 2 (beginning 11 March)

### Matvey Shuppe (Mon)

Didn't get none

### Jeremy Smith (Tues)

Jeremy liked that I was using Rubocop to help write good code,  running it frequently as we were going along. He also appreciated me helping him get a Rubocop linter up and running in VS Code.

He liked how I was refactoring as we were going along, in particular grouping tests together into contexts to improve readbility of code and RSpec output.

### Alex Chen

Didn't get feedback again... realised there was a workshop starting and cut our session abruptly short :-/

### Amy Jordan / Wardah Tarar

My pair was away, so I jumped in with Amy and Wardah. In retrospect we thought 'pairing' with three people wasn't so good as it was harder to keep all 3 people engaged without one getting left behind.

Wardah said she appreciated me going slowly and making an effort to keep her engaged by prompting her to add tests and code.

Amy said she found me very patient and calm, good at explaining things, good at making sure any individual didn't race ahead without bringing the whole 'pair' (of three) along with them.

## Week 3 (beginning 18 March)

### Sam - Monday

It wasn't real pairing as we had a bunch of stuff to read and learn rather than an exercise to work on, but Sam said she found me a good person to work with - good at explaining things and happy to work through things slowly even through I knew quite a bit of html and css already. She said she was looking forward to when we could pair properly on an exercise together!

### Matt - Tues

He was away so I worked on my own

### Tomé - Wednesday

Tomé said he learnt a lot from working with me, but at the end of the afternoon we started working independently, checking in when we completed each stage, and he said he would have preferred to carry on working together on the same computer as we would have been more engaged together, and he could have learnt more. This was my fault! Partly I was just got carried away with writing my own code... I won't do this again!

### Andrew - Thursday

He didn't come in, so I just worked on my birthday app thing

### Amy - Friday

Lots of good feedback from Amy - she said she like pairing with me because I have lots of good knowledge which I'm able to share and explain clearly, but I was also happy to go at a slower pace, reading over the learning material, and allowing her to try different things out when she was learning. She said she felt like she made good progress working with me.

## Week 4 (beginning 25 March)

### James Davies - Tuesday

> #### What went well?
>
> We found a good rhythm, with implementing tests. You stopped me from going off on a tangent at one point and reeled it in to follow a proper step by step TDD process. TDD is something I struggle to carry out sometimes as I like to “play” with code.
>
> Took your time to explain/look into things which I question, especially the erb syntax for `<%=` and `<%` and the difference between the two.
>
> #### What could he improve on for next time?
>
> We could have stopped and discussed what we had just implemented and wrote some notes/readme even if its a few words. This will help for our portfolios, etc. Git commits lacking!
> 
> #### Quick wins/ aka fishing for compliments
>
> You are easy to talk to, good conversation before we even started meant we had broken the ice beforehand.
>
> I appreciated the you look at me when you talk, as lip reading is so important to me.
>
> Good studying session before work.

### Arthur Ashman

Good session - we got a bit stuck going through the walkthrough for encapsulating database data in an object, but we got up a good ping-pong rhythm on the next part, deleting bookmarks.

Arthur said I was very patient when we were going through things that he didn't understand, and he appreciated going at a slower pace as it helps you understand the material better.

## Week 5 (beginning 1 April)

### Lauren - Monday

Bit of a rushed reflection as I was off to a process workshop. Lauren said I was very patient, allowing her to work through new things and come to a good understanding rather than rushing through. She also said my explanations helped her understand some of the new concepts, like the difference between classes/objects in Ruby and JavaScript, and e.g. JavaScript's `.prototype`.

### Amy - Wednesday

> You are a very calm and steady partner to work with, always willing to share your knowledge and time with everyone from the cohort. In today's session, as you were already comfortable with the initial subject area, I really appreciated that you were happy to go at a pace that worked for me, as a total newbie to this topic. It was great that you led the session while still providing time and space for me to work things out. I felt there was a good balance of giving me enough time/space (and then prompters) to work something out and then showing me something in action when I got stuck - the mix of the two helped me cement my understanding throughout the afternoon. Likewise, when we got onto content we both weren't familiar in, we worked together actively, sharing ideas and trying things out to see how things might work - this was fun! Equally when we had a different ideas about how something might go, we were both comfortable to share and discuss before settling on a way forward. You're a great pair and a pleasure to work with :slightly_smiling_face:
