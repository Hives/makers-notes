# Team feedback

## Week 6 - Makers BnB

### Greg's feedback

> As per point 4 of twelve points of agile development, your communication skills are excellent.  You are able to express complicated ideas and break them down in a way which is comprehensible for those working at a lower technical level.  You recognise the value of working in a team and were able to both deepen my understanding when appropriate, while also taking a technical lead role when required in order to deliver the goals of the project, as decided by the whole group.

> As per point 6, you showed appreciation, trust and a commitment to empowering others throughout the project.  It was very easy to work productively alongside you.
