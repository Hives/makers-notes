# Databases 2 - from domain models to database structures
*Tue 26 Mar*  
*Coach: Katerina*  
*[Workshop details](https://github.com/makersacademy/skills-workshops/tree/master/week-4/databases_2)*

## Learning objectives

An exercise to learn three things:

- Explain how to use CRC cards to model a domain
- Model a simple domain using CRC cards
- Infer database structure from domain structure

## Kick off

### What have we already learnt about databases?

- Primary key. Automatically generated by the database
- Primary key is for ever!
- Data restriction rules - you can set columns to store data in a particular format
- PG gem - connect to database in Ruby
- Foreign keys. E.g in the image below, the customer ID in the order table is the primary key from the customre table. That's called a foreign key.

## Class responsibility cards

Another way of modelling your domain. Shows 'responsbilities' and 'collaborators' for your classes.
