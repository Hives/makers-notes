### Monday - James Davies

#### What went well?

We found a good rhythm, with implementing tests. You stopped me from going off on a tangent at one point and reeled it in to follow a proper step by step TDD process. TDD is something I struggle to carry out sometimes as I like to “play” with code.

Took your time to explain/look into things which I question, especially the erb syntax for %= and % difference between the two.

#### What could he improve on for next time?

We could have stopped and discussed what we had just implemented and wrote some notes/readme even if its a few words. This will help for our portfolios, etc. Git commits lacking!

#### Quick wins/ aka fishing for compliments

You are easy to talk to, good conversation before we even started meant we had broken the ice beforehand.

I appreciated the you look at me when you talk, as lip reading is so important to me.

Good studying session before work.
