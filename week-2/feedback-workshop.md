# Feedback workshop

*Date: Wed 13 Mar*  
*Coach: Dana*

Feedback is one of the XP values (what's that?)

### What is feedback?

- information about reactions to a product, a person's peformance of a task, or behaviour which is used a basis for improvement

### Why is feedback so diffcult?

Love and acceptance vs. Learning and growth

Self-protection

### Feedback is everywhere

- sighing when you do the dishes
- internet trolls
- etc...

### How can we make feedback easier?

- structure
- "two stars and a wish"
- shit sandwich (lol)

5 points:

1. Shift your perspective
  - Morpheus meme: "what if i told you, there is no +ve or -ve feedback? only feedback"
  - Spongebob meme: "feedback is ðŸŒˆkindðŸŒˆ!"
2. Empower receiver
  - gatekeeper
  - helps us understand ourselves, profile, blind spots #freetherapy
  - helps us practive assertiveness, boundaries, cultivate authentic and equal relationships
  - improve work life and overall quality of life
3. Know thyself
  - 3 feedback triggers:
    1. **Truth** triggers - seems wrong or off target
    2. **Relationship** triggers - something about our relationship with the person
    3. **Identity** triggers - undermines how we see ourselves
  - Wrong-spotting: being on the look out for reasons to discard the feedback as invalid. Can end up missing useful feedback like this.
  - Blind spots. Discrepancy between how 'others see me' and how 'I see me'
  - How do we build resilience?
    - Understand your profile
      - What's your happiness set point (Oxford happiness questionnaire, 3mins, <http://happiness-survey.com>). Higher baseline tends to be more resilient to feedback
      - Swing: even-keeled or emotions change a lot?
      - Recovery/sustain - how long does it take to return to your baseline after a +ve or -ve swing?
4. Understanding feedback
  - 3 types. We need all three:
    1. Evaluation - "You really know your way around Pry."
    2. Appreciation - "I enjoyed pairing with you today!"
    3. Coaching - "You're rushing and I didn't follow that, can we go over it again?"
  - Use a framework:
    - A.S.K.
      - A: Actionable (avoid vague adjectives like good/bad, give them something they can act on)
      - S: Specific (be specific enough for them to come up with steps to improve)
      - K: ðŸŒˆKindðŸŒˆ (this one should be most obvious but is often the last consideration. It's hard to receive feedback it it's unkind.)
    - 4-part Nonviolent Communication Process
      - Observation
      - Feeling
      - Need
      - Request
5. Tips for giving/receiving feedback
  - Tips for giving feedback:
    - check in with yourself beforehand - what's the purpose of feedback?
    - ask permission to give feedback, respect boundaries
    - state the purpose of your feedback
    - give specific feedback
    - be direct and respectful
    - aim to help them grow, feedback is ðŸŒˆkindðŸŒˆ
  - Tips for receiving feedback:
    - make youre you're in the right headspace, decline if not
    - know your profile
    - try to listen attentively with an open mind
    - know that you (we all) have blind spots
    - be awere of triggers
    - take your time to weight and respond to feedback
    - know your boundaries and reject feedback respectfully if after weightin it carefully you do not wish to take it on board
    - if you take it on board, decide what you're going to do about it
    - thank the feedback giver because feedback is ðŸŒˆkindðŸŒˆ
