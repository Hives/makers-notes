### Sam - Monday

It wasn't real pairing as we had a bunch of stuff to read and learn rather than an exercise to work on, but Sam said she found me a good person to work with - good at explaining things and happy to work through things slowly even through I knew quite a bit of html and css already. She said she was looking forward to when we could pair properly on an exercise together!
