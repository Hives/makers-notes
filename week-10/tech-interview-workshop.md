# Tech Test workshop

*Wed 8 May, Week 10*  
*With Becks from the careers team*  

## Take home tech test

Example: [JustEat recruitment test](https://github.com/justeat/JustEat.RecruitmentTest#coding-test)

### Tips

- Don't cry
- Read the question
- Do your research
- Always TDD
- Communicate about timeframes and give yourself longer than you think you'll need - you may get another tech test out of the blue
- If you can't complete it at least get the MVP
- README - employers like user stories, diagrams... also use it to communicate with the employer

## Pairing interview

- Best practice for this is to do the process workshops. That's basically what a pairing/tech interview is like.
- These interviews are much more about teamwork than what you know
- Employers love diagramming
- Projects - you might be asked to talk through a project
    - what does that bit of code do?
    - how did your team work?
    - can you sketch the architecture?
    - discuss commits

## Tech chit chat

- Describe agile?
    - what is it
    - historical context
    - vs. waterfall
- What events have you been to?
- What's TDD?

### Alex interviewed me and Greg wrote these notes

"What makes you different?"
Big pause and "ermmmmm" at the beginning.

You came across as a bit shy and nervous at the beginning.  Body language? Think about it. Eye-contact? You seemed to be staring into space and not at the interviewer at some points.

Good to focus on the fact that you do have prior experience and that does differentiate you.  You did sigh at one point though, as though you were bored by the question.

"I don't have a preference over back end development".  Could you have talked about why some people might have strong opinions even if you personally don't?

You don't come across as confident in your achievements on the Acebook project.
Later on your body language and use of your hands came across much better.  Could you have talked about taking more of a leading role (assuming you did?)?

This is an interview to sell yourself and you didn't maybe use the pronoun "I" quite as much as "we". Obviously "we" highlights your team skills.  You could talk more about your being self-taught.  Great example in the music school.  Could you have mentioned the customer's feedback on this project? Great explanation of some of the functionality you worked on. 

Overall you are very clear in your explanations and you come across as knowledgeable and capable.

Encapsulation: great definition.

### Greg interviewed Alex and I made these notes

- If not a coder then?
   - Engineer - technical?
- Tell me about a project that failed
   - acebook - supposed to display posts and chat function, but failed because they could not figure out how to auto-scroll the chat, so you had to manually scroll. Alex fixed up the AWS to make it work
- Whats agile?
  - compared to Waterfall
  - changing requirements
  - rearrange team structure/project to fit new approach
  - always communicating with client
- How do you write quality software
  - TDD
  - refactor
  - clean up at the end with linter
- Why are cache invalidation and naming things considered to be so hard?
  - don't know first one
  - important for names to be unique
  - comprehensive name - people get it by seeing
- What do you love about testing
  - I love testing - means code won't break when it really matters
  - personal project with no tests, broke when he was demoing to client. testing would have prevented this
