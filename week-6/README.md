### Kick-off

It's about teamwork, agile practices etc...

Project is **[Makers B'n'B](https://github.com/makersacademy/course/tree/master/makersbnb)**

#### High level skills

To guide your learning, aim to be able to answer "yes" to the questions below. Return to these questions each day to guide your learning.

- Can you use the [**XP values**](http://www.extremeprogramming.org/values.html) to guide your behaviour?
    - Communication.
    - Simplicity.
    - Feedback.
    - Courage.
    - Respect.

- Can you follow the full [**developer workflow**](https://github.com/makersacademy/course/blob/master/pills/development_workflow.md)? (Creating issues, branching, reviewing, squirrelling, merging.)
    - Create an issue on GitHub
    - Create a branch for it
    - Pair on implementing the user story
    - Create a pull request
    - Get another team member to do a code review on it
    - Discuss and make improvements on code until you and reviewer are satisfied
    - Merge
    - Do some QA on live site
    - Highfive

- Can you keep code quality and test coverage high whilst building new features?
    - Should install Travis CI

#### Processes

By the end of the week all developers can build tested, easy-to-change software in a team using these processes:

- Break down projects into tasks and allocate them to pairs
- Build to a specificiation (rather than challenges)
    - Go back and check work against spec and mockups
- Run stand-ups and retrospectives
- Use a branch/PR/merge git workflow
- Give and receive meaningful code review

### Notes, Wednesday morning

- [Scrum diagram off Wikipedia][scrum]
- We've completed our MVP sprint, need to plan our next one. What's our next goal?
- Should we do a sprint retrospective?
- Get user flows working right - check against mockups, make sure all pages are accessible via navigation
- Code quality review? (should be doing these regularly)
- Travis CI
- Do I need to document/communicate what I've done on the html and css so other team members can create similar templates?
