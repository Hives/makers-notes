## <a name='goals'>Week 6 goals</a>

### Kick-off

It's about teamwork, agile practices etc...

Project is **[Makers B'n'B](https://github.com/makersacademy/course/blob/master/makersbnb/specification_and_mockups.md)**

#### High level skills

To guide your learning, aim to be able to answer "yes" to the questions below. Return to these questions each day to guide your learning.

- Can you use the **XP values** to guide your behaviour?
- Can you follow the full developer workflow? (Creating issues, branching, reviewing, squirrelling, merging.)
- Can you keep code quality and test coverage high whilst building new features?

#### Processes

By the end of the week all developers can build tested, easy-to-change software in a team using these processes:

- Break down projects into tasks and allocate them to pairs
- Build to a specificiation (rather than challenges)
- Run stand-ups and retrospectives
- Use a branch/PR/merge git workflow
- Give and receive meaningful code review

### Notes, Wednesday morning

- We've compled our MVP sprint, need to plan our next one. What's our next goal?
- Should we do a sprint retrospective?
- Get user flows working right - check against mockups, make sure all pages are accessible via navigation
- Code quaity review?
- Travis CI
- Do I need to document/communicate what I've done on the html and css so other team members can create similar templates?
