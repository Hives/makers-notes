## <a name='goals'>Week 5 goals</a>

### Kick-off

#### Questions from the weekend challenge

##### Understanding web app flow

People were talking about having trouble understanding the flow of their applications. Ed said a good exercise is to diagram the flow of data that happens when you submit a web form and make a change to a database. Maybe do this for the weekend challenge, for creating a peep?

##### WTF is Rake?

A Ruby task runner. In the context of the Chitter Challenge, it could be used to automate setting up the database across different environments.

#### Welcome to Javascript

##### Primary goal

By the end of the week, the goal is to be able to answer "yes" to the week's primary question:

- Can you learn a new language and its patterns?

##### How do you learn a new language?

- Tutorial (Codeacademy?)
- Hello world
- Look at examples
- RTFD

Think about how you know to do stuff in languages that you do know.
